The next step is to set up a bunch of web stuff that will make it easy for
workshop participants to access a given notebook instance.

There are several goals for this step:
 1) A participant should be able to reach their notebook with a simple,
    human-readable URL (ex: notebook03.openmcworkshop.org).
 2) The system should use the HTTPS protocol with SSL encryption so that a
    participant's web-browser allows them to use the site and does not raise
    annoying warnings.
 3) Ideally it should be fast and easy for the workshop hosts to add or remove
    notebook instances to the system on the day of the workshop.

Using one or more proxy servers seems to be a good way of achieving these goals.
All web traffic for the workshop domain name (e.g. openmcworkshop.org) can be
sent to the proxy server, and then the proxy can be set up to send requests for
a specific subdomain (e.g. notebook03.openmcworkshop.org) to a corresponding
EC2 instance. The routing can be easily changed in real-time by updating the
configuration files on the proxy server. (This allows the hosts to wait until
just before the workshop to start the notebook instances, and it also allows the
hosts to quickly add new instances if needed.) The proxy server can also perform
"SSL termination" for the notebook instances.


* Register a domain name
  + Make sure to do this step well before the workshop! It may take several
    days.
  + There are many different companies that will sell you a domain name. For the
    ANS Student 2021 conference, we used AWS Route 53.
  + NOTE: Sterling Harper owns the openmcworkshop.org domain name. Feel free to
    reach out to him if you want to use that domain name for your workshop.

* Get signed SSL certificates for the workshop domain.
  + Again, make sure to do this well before the workshop.
  + We used AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for the ANS Student 2021 conference.
    However, this might not be the best option. The certificate itself is cheap,
    but it requires you to use EC2 Nitro Enclave instances for the proxy
    servers. The Nitro Enclave instances are not easy to set up, and they
    require a beefy instance type like c5.2xlarge which is expensive to leave
    running for many days when preparing for the workshop. In retrospect,
    LetsEncrypt might be a better provider. The ACM Nitro Enclave steps are
    described here:
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html
  + Be sure to get a "wildcard" certificate (e.g. *.openmcworkshop.org)

* Recommended: watch or read a tutorial on setting up a reverse proxy in NGINX
  + For example: https://youtu.be/B62QSbPhh1s

* Set up an EC2 instance for the NGINX proxy server
  + The Amazon Linux 2 AMI is a good AMI for this server.
  + Open the HTTP and HTTPS traffic in the security settings
  + If you're using ACM, make sure you use an instance type that supports Nitro
    Enclave.
  + Install nginx
    + (With the Amazon Linux AMI) amazon-linux-extras install nginx1
  + Make sure nginx is running
    + sudo service nginx status
    + (If necessary) sudo service nginx start
  + Test that nginx is live and accessible
    + You should be able to connect at http://{public_ip_address} and see a
      test page made by NGINX.

* Direct traffic to the proxy server
  + Reserve an Elastic IP with AWS
  + Assign the Elastic IP to the proxy server
  + (This way you will have one persistent IP address that you can keep when the
    proxy server is not running, and you can easily switch it from one server to
    another for testing purposes.)
  + Using AWS Route 53 create a DNS record that routes traffic for your wildcard
    domain (e.g. *.openmcworkshop.org) to the Elastic IP that you reserved.
  + Note that it may take a few minutes for the various public DNS servers to
    pick up this new record.
  + Test that traffic is being routed to your reserved IP address
    + On Linux you can use the "dig" command. Any address that matches your
      wildcard domain (e.g. foo.openmcworkshop.org or test.openmcworkshop.org)
      should be routed to the reserved IP.
  + Try accessing the server via web browser (e.g. navigate to
    http://foo.openmcworkshop.org). This should again show the NGINX test page.

* Set configuration files
  + You may need to modify the "nginx.conf" file. An example file is included
    in the openmc-workshop-tools repo.
  + The nginx.conf file should have the line,
    "include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf". This line means that we can put
    the .conf files that specify the workshop proxy in the /etc/nginx/default.d
    directory.
  + Make the /etc/nginx/default.d/templ subdirectory. This is where we will
    store template NGINX configurations that will be included in the .conf
    files.
  + Add the the "loc_templ.conf" and "server_templ.conf" files (from the
    openmc-workshop-tools repo) to the templ subdirectory
  + Add the "main.conf" file to the conf.d directory. This file will redirect
    HTTP requests to HTTPS. It also includes a configuration for the domain
    name "welcome.openmcworkshop.org" that is meant to redirect to the
    URL-provider webapp (covered later in the notes.)

* Test the reverse proxy
  + Launch an instance using the AMI set up earlier in these notes and execute
    the "run_jupyter.sh" script on that instance to start Jupyter Lab.
  + Add a .conf to the conf.d directory on the proxy server (the file can use
    any prefix, e.g. example.conf) with contents that look like this (replace
    the {jupyter_instance_ip} with the private IP address of the instance that's
    running Jupyter Lab):
server {
  server_name example0.openmcworkshop.org;
  include /etc/nginx/conf.d/templ/server_templ.conf;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://{jupyter_instance_ip}:8888;
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/templ/loc_templ.conf;
  }
}
  + sudo service nginx reload
  + Visit the domain you used for "server_name" (e.g.
    example0.openmcworkshop.org) in the web browser. You should see the Jupyter
    notebook, and your browser should indicate that it is using HTTPS.
  + Remove the test .conf file when you are finished.


The proxy server is now ready to go. You can stop the EC2 instance that is
running the server when it is not in use in order to save money. The IP address
that was reserved with Elastic IPs will be persistent so you should not have to
update the DNS records when restarting the server.
